# Adding a new language

1. Create a new file with the name according to the `ISO 639-1` in the languages directory and write the translations as shown in the example:

2. Import the new added language to the language store and add it to the translations object as shown in the example:

3. Add the new language to the selection/list.(src/components/LanguageDropdown.vue)

```typescript
Before Lithuanian was added:
const flags: Record<string, string> = {
  en: 'fi fi-gb',
  cz: 'fi fi-cz',
}

After lithuanian was added:
const flags: Record<string, string> = {
  en: 'fi fi-gb',
  cz: 'fi fi-cz',
  lt: 'fi fi-lt'
}
```

The country code should be [taken from here](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) and implemented like so:

```typescript
'ISO 639-1 code for the language': 'fi fi-ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code of a country'
```

These rules should be followed for a static and managable structure. (Not following them might and will result in errors. e.g incorrect flag representing the language)

## It is curicial to follow `ISO 639-1` standarts, for ease of management and implementation.

## Incase of content changing in views or adding new views that require new text and translations please don't forget to update the translations.ts in types. (And update all the existing languages too)
